# 📸 Attendance Automation System using Face Recognition

A Python-based smart attendance automation system that uses **OpenCV** and **Haar Cascade Classifiers** for real-time **face detection and recognition**. This system captures student faces through a webcam and automatically marks attendance by recognizing the faces from a pre-trained dataset, storing the logs in a local database.

## 🎯 Objective

To automate the traditional manual attendance system using **AI-powered face recognition**, improving **accuracy**, **security**, and **convenience** in educational and organizational environments.
